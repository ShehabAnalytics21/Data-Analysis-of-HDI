<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project:
*	The Human Development Index (HDI) is an index that ranks nations into four levels of human development based on statistics related to life expectancy, education levels, and per capita income.
*	In this report, the relationship between the different components of HDI will be studied and analysed, specifically, two main questions of interest are to be addressed in this report, the two questions are: 
  1.	Is there a relationship between the Mean Years of Schooling and the Gross National Income per capita?
  2.	How much difference is there in the expected years of schooling between different countries of different HDI rankings?
